Technical Ratings
The Technical Ratings indicator is a composite tool that combines signals from multiple popular indicators into a single, normalized score (rating), then determines a rating category — such as "Buy" or "Sell" — based on the value. It provides a more compact and intuitive way to analyze a market's technical factors and find potential signals than analyzing each constituent indicator separately.

This indicator evaluates ratings based on a set of conditions from 26 constituent indicators, including moving averages and oscillators. Additionally, it evaluates those ratings across multiple timeframes and displays their categories in a table. The indicator can show rating information for the moving averages, the oscillators, or a combination of both.


The ratings from this indicator are the same as those displayed by the "Rating" columns of the Screener and the gauges on a symbol's "Technicals" page.

Calculation
This indicator calculates the following three ratings on each bar:

Moving average rating (MAs): The mean of ratings based on 15 moving averages and filters, including Simple and Exponential MAs with different lengths (10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200), Hull MA (9), VWMA (20), and Ichimoku Cloud (9, 26, 52)
Oscillator rating (Oscillators): The mean of ratings based on 11 oscillators and indicators, including  RSI (14), Stochastic (14, 3, 3), CCI (20), ADX (14, 14), Awesome Oscillator, Momentum (10), MACD (12, 26, 9), Stochastic RSI (3, 3, 14, 14), Williams %R (14), Bull Bear Power (13), and UO (7, 14, 28)
Overall rating (All): The mean of the moving average and oscillator ratings
Each constituent indicator contributes a value of -1 (for "sell"), 0 (for "neutral"), or +1 (for "buy") to the average ratings on each selected timeframe. The resulting averages oscillate between -1 and +1, where:

A positive value indicates a higher confluence of "buy" conditions than "sell" conditions on the bar
A negative value indicates a higher confluence of "sell" conditions than "buy" conditions on the bar
The indicator displays the moving average, oscillator, or overall rating for its main timeframe as color-coded columns in a separate pane. The table displays one of five categories for the enabled rating types on each selected timeframe. The following logic determines the assigned category for each score:

Strong Sell: Score is below -0.5
Sell: Score is below -0.1 and above or equal to -0.5
Neutral: Score ranges from -0.1 to 0.1
Buy: Score is above 0.1 and below or equal to 0.5
Strong Buy: Score is above 0.5
Individual indicator conditions
The Technical Ratings indicator uses the following criteria to calculate ratings for each constituent indicator:

All moving averages
Buy: MA value < price
Sell: MA value > price
Neutral: MA value = price
Ichimoku Cloud
Buy: Leading span A > Leading span B, Base line > Leading span A, Conversion line > Base line, and price > Conversion line
Sell: Leading span A < Leading span B, Base line < Leading span A, Conversion line < Base line, and price < Conversion line
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Relative Strength Index
Buy: RSI < 30 and RSI > previous RSI
Sell: RSI > 70 and RSI < previous RSI
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Stochastic
Buy: %K < 20, %D < 20, and %K > %D
Sell: %K > 80, %D > 80, and %K < %D
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Commodity Channel Index
Buy: CCI < -100 and CCI > previous CCI
Sell: CCI > 100 and CCI < previous CCI
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Average Directional Index
Buy: +DI > -DI, ADX > 20, and ADX > previous ADX
Sell: +DI < -DI, ADX > 20, and ADX < previous ADX
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Awesome Oscillator
Buy: AO crosses over 0, or AO is above 0 for two consecutive bars and turns upward (the current value is above the value from the previous bar, and the previous bar's value is below the value from two bars back)
Sell: AO crosses under 0, or AO is below 0 for two consecutive bars and turns downward (the current value is below the value from the previous bar, and the previous bar's value is above the value from two bars back)
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Momentum
Buy: Current value > previous value
Sell: Current value < previous value
Neutral: Current value = previous value
MACD
Buy: MACD > Signal
Sell: MACD < Signal
Neutral: MACD = Signal
Stochastic RSI
Buy: Downtrend, K < 20, D < 20, and K > D
Sell: Uptrend, K > 80, D > 80, and K < D
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Williams Percent Range
Buy: %R < -80 and %R > previous value
Sell: %R > -20 and %R < previous value
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Bull Bear Power
Buy: Uptrend, Bear power < 0, and Bear power > previous value
Sell: Downtrend, Bull power > 0, and Bull power < previous value
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Ultimate Oscillator
Buy: Oscillator > 70
Sell: Oscillator < 30
Neutral: Neither Buy nor Sell
Inputs

Indicator timeframe
The timeframe on which to calculate the indicator's primary rating. It must be higher than or equal to the chart's timeframe. The indicator plots the requested rating as columns and shows the category of the latest realtime value in the first row of the table. Additionally, the indicator uses the plotted rating for its alert conditions.

Rating is based on
Specifies which rating groups the indicator uses for its display and alerts:

All: The plot and alerts use the overall rating, and the table includes columns for all three rating groups
MAs: The indicator uses the moving average rating only
Oscillators: The indicator uses the oscillator rating only
Plot confirmed ratings only
This setting applies only to the indicator's plotted rating. If enabled and the indicator's primary rating comes from a higher timeframe than the chart's timeframe, the plotted value from the last closed HTF bar persists until after the latest HTF bar closes. If not enabled, the plot updates while the HTF bar is open to show the latest realtime changes in the requested rating. Note that the plot displays only the confirmed rating for each closed HTF bar after chart reloads.

Show MTF
These inputs control the additional timeframes for which the table displays rating categories. Each enabled timeframe has a separate corresponding row in the table.

Note that the table automatically excludes repeated timeframes. If two enabled timeframes, including the indicator's timeframe, are the same, the table displays only one row for that timeframe, not two.


Table settings
These inputs configure the appearance and layout of the table:

Size: Specifies the relative size of the table's text
Position: Sets the vertical (top, middle, bottom) and horizontal (left, center, right) placement of the table in the pane
Color inputs: Set the table's text and header colors, and the background colors for each rating category. The Buy, Neutral, and Sell color inputs also set the colors of the plotted columns.
